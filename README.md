### 🧑‍💻 To run the project locally

- Go to the top of the folder and run `npm start` to start the node server at `localhost:3001`.
- In another terminal (yeah, I know, sorry) navigate to the frontend folder and run `npm start` to start the react app in `localhost:3000`.

### 💻🤔 Project basic usage

Once you have the project running, you can open in your browser the following link to test the fibonacci node api. `localhost:3001/api/fibonacci/100000` where you can replace `100000` with any positive whole number you like.
_you can test sending an incorrect parameter like letters so you get a malformed error_.

To take a look at the react app please open in your browser the following link to test the fibonacci react app. `localhost:3000`.

There you can see an inputfield where you can enter any value you want.
and press the `Calculate` button to get your result.

if your result is too long it will get shortened but you can open the browser console to se a log of your full number!.

## 📘 Running **Tests**

To run the test on the node back end please go to the top of your project folder and run `npm test`.

for the front end testing please navigate to the frontend folder and run `npm test`
